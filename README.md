## What to do
- Download the firefox css content
- Enable CSS
- Enjoy

### How to Use
- Open a new tab and search for: about:support
- Now look for Profile Folder and press button the butten next to it called "Open Folder"
- If there is a folder called "chrome" enter it if not create one
- Drag all the installed files into the "chrome" folder
- In Firefox open a new tab and search for about:config
- It will tell you to not open the following tab which we ignore because we dont care
- In the searchbar search for "toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets" and doubleclick the "false" statement which turns it to "true"
- Now we enabled the CSS changes, and need to install an AddOn for Firefox called "Tree Style Tab"
- If you have done that you can close all firefox tabs and restart firefox
- Enjoy it ;)
